hello ,I'm JiangEn

I will give you a brief introduction to this project and how to use it.
When you download it, open it with VScode or any other code editor, then open the src folder which contains our main files. Before running the program, you may be missing some dependencies, which may cause the program to fail, please follow the prompts to install.
Here's what the main files do.

1.APP.tsx is the entry point or main component file for your React application. Click on it, then type npm run dev in the terminal, and when the link pops up, click on Local: http://localhost:5173/, which will open our webpage in your browser.
2. Homepage.tsx is the project's homepage. It describes the main content of each page.
3.rainlist can select a certain year to display
4.MyFirstPage.tsx has five different charts.
5.MysecondPage.tsx has a three-dimensional scatterplot.
6. rainDataProvider.ts is a data file.
7. theme.ts is the theme style file. (but not used in many places, this is a final project program after all)
8.CustomMenu.tsx is a customized menu component. Other parts of the page to be displayed in the menu, you must add code in this file.

If you have any questions,you can contact my email 2753983995@qq.com
Good luck for you.
